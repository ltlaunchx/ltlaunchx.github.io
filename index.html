              <br><br>
              Over the course of the year, students develop their own companies and startups from ideation to execution, ultimately competing against each other
              in regional and global pitch events for the chance to win a $5000 grant to continue their ventures. 
             <br><br>
              By providing teenage entrepreneurs with the platform and tools to develop their creativity and network with other like-minded peers, 
              we hope to inspire students with the tenacity to build and pursue their own viable startups.    
              Our mission is to incite creativity in the young entrepreneur and provide the tools necessary to build the lives and ideal world they envision.
              The focus of the program is on taking action, learning from results, helping students become successful entrepreneurs, and most importantly, having fun.
