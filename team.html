              <p>Yamilett is an advocate for gender equality in technology and a sophomore at Lane Tech College Prep. Social entrepreneur, programmer, and amateur boxer, Yamilett
                would most likely classify herself as

                  <span id="moreYames">
                    a<i> maker</i>. Whether she's coding a website, making DIY fireworks with her brother, or working on an app, she is driven by a desire to create impactful things
                    out of the minimal and inflict change, whether it be on a micro or macro scale. For her, entrepreneurs are the epitome of resiliency. They are risk-takers who defy odds
                    in order to realize their ideal vision of the world. At <i>Protostar</i>, she teaches peers about the entrepreneurial process, helps leverage their resources by providing
                    insightful tips and connections, and boosts morale! Outside of <i>Protostar</i>, she leads CS workshops at her local middle school and library's YOUMEDIA center and is
                    heavily involved in all-female CS communities as an NCWIT Awardee and #BUILTBYGIRLS Advisee. During her free time, she likes to workout at the <i>Sam Colonna Boxing Gym</i>, 
                    drink copious amounts of coffee, and attend local hackathons and tech meetups. Through her experiences, she hopes to close the gender gap in STEM and inspire minorities and first
                    generation Americans, like herself, to pursue careers in tech.
